taste.title = Taste it by Science
taste.first = With our precise measurement, advanced technology, and comprehensive data, you can see it before drink it! Bubble Rater gives you the most accurate guide for bubble milk tea.
taste.second = One cup of delicious bubble milk tea = Bouncy pearls + Rich milk tea + Perfect sweetness Where can you find the best bubble milk tea? Let us tell you with actual figures!
bubble.title = The bounciness of<br> pearls
bubble.first = We measure the elastic modulus of pearls right after buying the tea. The higher it goes, the bouncier it is! With our equipment, we compress the pearl up to 50%. Combines with the deformation of its cross-sectional area and the stress it generates, the elastic modulus is thus derived.
tea.title = The richness of<br> milk
tea.first = We use viscosity as our measuring target. With more viscosity, the milk tea itself has less fluidity. Which leads to a richer taste of milk and tea. Via our falling ball viscometer, the falling ball within the milk tea would reach the terminal speed due to the equilibrium between gravity, buoyancy, and viscous resistance under laminar flow status. After calculation, we can acquire the viscosity of the milk tea.
sweetness.title = The sweetness of<br> tea
sweetness.first = Degrees Brix is the sugar content of an aqueous solution. One degree Brix is 1 gram of sucrose in 100 grams of solution. We precisely present the Degrees Brix of each brand of our targeted bubble milk tea. So you can easily distinguish the sugar content of them.
subtitle.content = To sum up, Bubble Rater transform all the ratings above into scores between 5 to 10 points. Just leave the boring testing and measuring steps to us, we can present you the best and most delicious bubble milk tea!
bottom.first = The target item of our comparison on the website is Bubble Fresh Milk Tea. In order to be fair, the iced tea is with the configuration of 30% sugar and no ice, the hot tea is with 30% sugar. If the item cannot adjust the sweetness and ice level, we will label it separately.
bottom.second = To prevent pearls from mushing and crystallizing, all the measurement are done within 30 minutes after purchase. The score of the richness of milk tea is base on the contribution of milk to the viscosity. It does not represent the content of the milk.
bottom.third = Our falling ball viscometer and its calculation presumed the milk tea is Newtonian fluid and has less than 1 Renault number while falling the ball.
bottom.fourth = The rates will dynamically change as new datas are added in. The rates here represent the ranking of each subject on a scale of 5-10.
bottom.fifth =Please beware that the comparison points on the website are educated guesses or predictions and as such, please take it for reference only.
bottom.sixth = Please take a time stamp while quoting our ratings since the scores vary due to the constant increase of total target items. EX: Score: 9.2 (2019/5/2)
